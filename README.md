# shiftletters
A little C++ program to shift letters given one of various strings.

Usage: `shiftletters n <string1> <string2> ...` where n is the number of letters we wa

Example: `shiftletters 3 hello world`

Output: `khoor zruog` (we have shifted every letter by 3 positions, so that `h` turns `k` because `k` is 3 positions beyond `h` in the alphabet, `e` turns `h`, and so on).
